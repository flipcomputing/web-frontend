##### Hide records / Prepare for Removal
Tell the server that you want to: 
- Mark records in a table for deletion (soft-delete)
- Keep itâ€™s cache (any incrementing keys, indexes, data space)
- Some Database Management Systems will remove them completely

```
DELETE
FROM <schema_name>.<table_name>
WHERE <field1> = <value1>;
```

<div class="warning">IMPORTANT:</div>
<div class="warning">- Deleting will remove existing data. Check before committing!</div>
<div class="warning">- If there is no WHERE clause, every row will be deleted.</div>
<div class="warning">- Not a pleasant feeling if done unintentionally!</div>

###### stage_Product_Offers

Let's remove any offers from the `stage_Product_Offers` table where:
- The offer started before 1st May 2021

```
DELETE
FROM "sequel-mart-schema"."stage_Product_Offers"
WHERE offer_start_date < '2021-05-01';
```

This removes the 3 offers from our table that started before 1st May 2021
